# Opus Header Parsing Library

Parsing of Opus Headers according to the !(specification)[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7845#section-5]
Simply supply anything that implements the std::io::Read trait to the parse function.
There is a usage example that can be run with cargo run --example read_headers.

# License

As this library was created to allow opus support in !(polaris)[https://github.com/agersant/polaris], it uses the same License: MIT.
Maybe I will add Apache too.
